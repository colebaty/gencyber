## key differences between linux and windows/macos
*Proprietary vs. open source*.
- proprietary: "intellectual property". a company owns the rights to develop,
  distribute, sell, do all the capitalism with a product
- open source: the source code is freely available. anyone can examine it,
  modify it, republish it (within limits)

*GUI-based vs. terminal-based*
- Graphical User Interface (GUI): point and click
- Terminal, aka command line: 1337 sup3r h4xx0r

associated with the command line/terminal
